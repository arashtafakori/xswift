XSwift is a framework that has been created based on DDD and CQRS concepts. This framework helps developers to boost the process of development to produce scaled backed-end and be able to implement details like invariants, and specifications, and further helps them to architect complexity easily. The code volume of a project that has been developed based on the xswift is significantly lower. It provides a structure for developers to focus on the business instead of spending time on the code and solving challenges related to the code.
