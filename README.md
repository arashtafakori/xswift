XSwift is an open-source and lightweight library that has been created based on Clean Architecture and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) approaches. This library helps developers to boost the process of development to produce scaled Backed-End and be able to implement details like invariants, and specifications, and further helps them to architect complexity easily. The code volume of a project that has been developed based on the xswift is significantly less. It provides an infrastructure for developers to focus on the business instead of spending time on the code and solving challenges related to the mass and repetitive codes.
